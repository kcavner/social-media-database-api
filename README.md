# Social Media Database API

## Description
- This application uses nosql technology to create a database and api to perform different functionality to users and their thoughts and reactions.
## Details
- MongoDB was the database that was used to create the database and api. Functions that set up the api endpoints were kept separate from the crud operations for better readability. A walkthrough video was made showcasing each api endpoints functionality and response json featured for each one. Creating users, updating them, deleting them, getting them. Creating thoughts, updating them, deleting them, and creating and deleting reactions to those thoughts.
## What i learned
- Learning Mongoose and mongoDB was made easier now that i feel more comfortable navigating documentation and utilizing insomnia api to debug my api endpoints. My knowledge of navigating objects in javascript was improved by this project due to the models created and use of subdocuments. I learned a lot of methods specific to mongoDB like findOneAndUpdate and findById. I am looking forward to working more with object based databases in the future.
